### Sentiment-Analysis-and-Semantic-Search-with-Hugging-Face

ðŸ›  Building NLP Applications with Hugging Face
ðŸ“– Overview
This project explores the development of advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications using Hugging Face libraries. It focuses on three primary tasks: sentiment analysis, text embedding, and semantic search. The dataset used is the "Rent the Runway" dataset, which includes user reviews of clothing items, ratings on fit, and metadata about users and items.

ðŸ”§ Key Features
1.Sentiment Analysis: Classifies user reviews into positive or negative sentiments using a fine-tuned DistilBERT model.
2.Text Embedding: Converts textual data into numerical vector representations for further analysis.
3.Semantic Search: Matches user queries with the most relevant results based on text embeddings.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Details
The "Rent the Runway" dataset includes:
1.User reviews, ratings, and metadata (e.g., gender, height, size, age).
2.Item-specific details such as category and reason for renting.

ðŸ“ˆ Insights and Visualizations
The project analyzes sentiment trends over time and visualizes the distribution of sentiment scores. These insights provide valuable information about customer preferences and behavior.
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning models to real-world datasets to solve practical NLP challenges.
